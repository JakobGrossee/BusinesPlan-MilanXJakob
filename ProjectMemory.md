Purpose & context
Milan is the founder of Bambini, a German startup that centralizes social benefit applications for parents (Elterngeld, Kindergeld, and Elternzeit) in one platform. The primary goal is to simplify bureaucratic processes for their target demographics: academics and people with language barriers in Germany. Success involves building a legally compliant, profitable platform while managing external partnership obligations. Milan is working with a new partnership opportunity with ARAG insurance company that requires specific integration features including FAQ pages and AI chat functionality. The business operates on a 49.99 euro price point with low monthly operating costs, requiring minimal customer volume for profitability.
Current state
Milan is managing three competing priorities: ARAG integration requirements with external deadlines, legal verification of current implementation against BEEG regulations, and technical debt from V1 infrastructure. The current V1 system handles existing functionality but needs legal verification before serving test customers. ARAG has provided an urgent timeline with a test customer ready, requiring updated business case calculations and go-live timelines. Milan has identified that ARAG integration can be decoupled from V2 development, allowing shipment on existing infrastructure while refactoring continues separately.
On the horizon
The roadmap shows ARAG MVP completion by end of February 2026, legal verification by end of March, and V2 system completion by end of May. Milan is preparing for GmbH formation and securing approximately 22,000 euros in total funding. A comprehensive business case has been developed showing profitability at just 3 customers per month. Research into Customer Acquisition Costs across different marketing channels is planned to optimize growth strategies for the target demographics.
Key learnings & principles
Milan has learned to decouple external partnership requirements from core platform refactoring, allowing parallel development streams. The business model validation showed extremely low break-even requirements (3 customers monthly), indicating strong unit economics. Strategic prioritization emerged as critical when managing competing technical debt, partnership obligations, and legal compliance requirements simultaneously.
Approach & patterns
Milan approaches complex startup challenges by breaking them into structured priority frameworks and creating detailed technical architecture plans. Problem-solving involves comprehensive documentation including timelines, business cases, and technical specifications. Communication with partners is handled through detailed German correspondence, and strategic decisions are supported by financial modeling and market research planning.
Tools & resources
The technical stack includes Supabase edge functions for backend infrastructure, system prompt stuffing for knowledge base architecture, and plans for AI chat widget integration. Milan uses pitch deck analysis for revenue projections and structured timeline documentation for project management. German regulatory compliance (BEEG regulations) serves as a key legal framework for product development.
